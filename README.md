# Errors in DotNetCore 1.0

##Project Solution Folders

To submit an error, add a pull request for a self contained Solution folder like fix_no_commands_project_json with the error project and the fix proj included.  There can be more than one error listed in a single solution folder as long as its short and succinct and doesn't detract from the other errors or fixes.  The error must be in a separate project. The fix must also be in a separate project. Note: The solutions folder must be an actual folder that the error and fix projects can be placed.

Optional items should be clearly specificed in the readme markdown files.

1. no commands in project json 
    * error
    * fix
2. todo
